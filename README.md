- Now go to your terminal and type: `git clone <the link here>` and then the repo will be cloned to your local machine.
- By now you have to open your IDE -I recommend VSCode- and open the project.
- to open a live page from your local machine project, you can download the `live Server` extension. This's a [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to the extension.
